hello-world
===========

Hello! Elizabeth here - you can call me Eli or Liz if you'd like.
I'm an M.Sc. student at Concordia University, studying biology.
My thesis is a macro-ecological approach for assessing Canadian biodiversity.
In my spare time I practice judo, and paint if I'm feeling creative.

Really love working with and learning about R and am relatively new to GitHub.
But I'm liking it so far! Pretty neat.

Cheers!
